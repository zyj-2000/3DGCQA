(This is a draft document that provides only a brief introduction to the contents of the 3DGCQA, and will be further refined later.)

## 0. File Structure

**obj**: folder, contains all AIGCs' mesh, UV map and MTL file.

**3DGCQA-info.csv**: csv file, contains the time consumed for each 3D AIGC generation. (Some of the durations are very long due to the generation algorithms getting stuck)

**3DGCQA-mos.csv**: csv file, contains subjective scores (alignment and quality) for each 3D AIGC.

## 1. How to Access the 3DGCQA Database
